## Installation Guide


1. Clone the Repo onto the local machine.

2. Have Android Studio setup and download Android 8.1 (Oreo) as the SDK Platform.

3. Within Android Studio, build the project for the first time and allow 2-5 minutes for the gradle to complete building.

4. Run the emulator in Android Studio. For Virtual Devices, our team used the Pixel 2 API 27.

5. Test the application.

*For the code structure, we have java classes, and each class links to a res folder that stores our xml files. We use Firebase as our data structure and each class implements with Firebase.*
